This is a solution to the problem presented above.

The machine learning model is TensorFlow Keras seqeuntial neural network.

It contains 4 layers and has ~80% accuracy in detecting defects

Some examples of defects are shown below, This model uses simplified VLSI circuit shapes for training and testing.
